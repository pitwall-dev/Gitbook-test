# 2. Ondemand lookup

## Create a new ondemand lookup

Browser extension utilizes a single word or multiple words to look up. There are 2 steps through a simple copy & paste operation.

STEP 1 - Preparing a sample URL from the your existing sites / tools / dashboards.&#x20;

STEP 2 - Configuring the URL to get the ad-hoc lookup mechanisms ready.

STEP 3 - Test the configuration with the browser extension.

### STEP 1 - Preparing a sample URL from the your existing sites / tools / dashboards.

Once you open a browser, please go to a tool your team uses and bring the page of what your team uses.

For example, AbuseIPDB ([https://www.abuseipdb.com/](https://www.abuseipdb.com/)), a project dedicated to helping combat the spread of hackers, spammers, and abusive activity on the internet. People use the site for IP reputation and malware site check.&#x20;

When you open the website, before you copy the URL in the browser, make sure you run an <mark style="color:blue;">**actual lookup**</mark> like the following<mark style="color:blue;">**.**</mark>\


`https://www.abuseipdb.com/check/61.177.173.41`

### STEP 2 - Configuring the URL to get the ad-hoc lookup mechanisms ready.

As you can find out what part of the URL needs to be parameterized, paste the copied URL in the destination URL box and click "**URL customization**".&#x20;

In this example, the IP address part (61.177.173.41) needs to be parameterized.\


Original URL - &#x20;

* `https://www.abuseipdb.com/check/61.177.173.41`

Parameterized URL

* `https://www.abuseipdb.com/check/{$key}`

{% hint style="info" %}
If the site is not automatically detected in the studio, there isn't any functional impact. However, adding an extension will be enriching the studio visually and a little bit more fun. There are two options.

1. Go to "[Extensions](../../pitwall-extensions.md#2.-adding-time-format-s-to-detect-timestamps-from-the-url-you-would-like-to-parameterize-in-the-stud-1)" in the main menu, and add your own extension by uploading an icon image. Also, you can contribute the extension to the PITWALL community so it'd be beneficial for everyone.&#x20;
2. Contact us via a chat and we enable the extension for you.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

### STEP 3 - Test the configuration with the browser extension.

Now, open the browser extension and sign in to your account.

1. Go to a scenario and pick up the site you'd like to lookup.
2. Select a text (value) and click the **find** button to lookup.
3. You can also take a screenshot (downloadable PNG) by the **snap** button for other purposes such as reporting.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
For the private alpha, snapshot is not available, but is in a roadmap towards beta.&#x20;
{% endhint %}
