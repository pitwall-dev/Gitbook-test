# 3. Open by Group

## What is "Open by Group"?

With the browser extension, you can lookup multiple sites with a single click. This is a very powerful feature when you need to lookup multiple sites with the same value such as checking the IP reputation across multiple sites. This will allow you to save your time rather than looking up a site one by one. Here is how to enable this.

1. Add multiple lookups (sites) in the studio.
   * These sites need to use the same key. For example, the name of the key -> $key
   * These lookups need to belong to the same **destination group**.

{% hint style="info" %}
**destination group**\
\
Naming the **destination group** is helpful for you to identify what lookups are configured. For example, let's name a destination group to be "IP Reputation" updated from "default".

Then, multiple lookups in the destination group are now categorized properly.

* IP Reputation
  * AbuseIPDB
  * VIRUSTOTAL
  * URLhaus
{% endhint %}

2\. Open the browser extension and select the destination group (not each lookup). It'll trigger a lookup across all the sites configured in the destination group.&#x20;
