There are 3 steps to create a scenario.

{% content-ref url="1.-trigger/" %}
[1.-trigger](1.-trigger/)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% content-ref url="2.-lookup.md" %}
[2.-lookup.md](2.-lookup.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% content-ref url="3.-recipient.md" %}
[3.-recipient.md](3.-recipient.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

The following tutorial enables a scenario by using an example here. \
An alert is triggered by a monitoring tool (Coralogix) and based on the scenario created by PITWALL, the lookups are stitched together and you will receive it in tools like Slack, MS Teams and email.\
