# 2. Lookup

## Create a new lookup (destination)

This is the main part of scenario where you configure what you would like to review and analyze at the time of incidents / events / when you need a set of research.

There are mainly 3 steps to complete this configuration. It is just as simple as copy & paste experience.

STEP 1 - Preparing a sample URL from the your existing sites / tools / dashboards.&#x20;

STEP 2 - Configuring the URL to get the dynamic lookup mechanisms ready.

STEP 3 - Enabling snapshot if you would like to prefetch and/or periodically take actual screenshot(s) of your existing sites / tools / dashboards.&#x20;



### STEP 1 - Preparing a sample URL from the your existing sites / tools / dashboards.

Once you open a browser, please go to a tool your team uses and bring the page of what your team uses for actual troubleshooting or incident analysis.

For example, this is a dashboard built by Kibana (one of the most commonly used open source visualization softwares) by Coralogix.&#x20;

When you open the dashboard, before you copy the URL in the browser, make sure <mark style="color:blue;">**the time range is manually specified**</mark>. If your tool gives "last 15 mins" or something relative way, make sure there is a specific **from:** and **to:** specified by absolute way like Sep 23, 2022 @ 00:03:06 to Sep 23, 2022 @ 01:03:06. This will allow PITWALL to dynamically align the time range of the dashboard at the time of an incident.&#x20;

The copied URL should look something like below : \
\
`https://`_`yourtenant`_`.coralogix.com/#/app/kibana#/dashboard/d1afbef0-4906-11ec-8b23-b372b1e7ae1d?_g=(refreshInterval:(pause:!t,value:0),time:`**`(from:'2022-09-23T07:03:06.000Z',to:'2022-09-23T08:03:06.000Z')`**`)&_a=(description:'',filters:!(),fullScreenMode:!f,options:(hidePanelTitles:!f,useMargins:!t),panels:!((embeddableConfig:(),gridData:(h:27,i:'188b3cb8-1f32-488c-b44c-99c46ecaa2d1',w:48,x:0,y:0),id:'5ffed850-50c1-11ec-a30d-7fdab983d73c',panelIndex:'188b3cb8-1f32-488c-b44c-99c46ecaa2d1',type:visualization,version:'7.4.2')),query:(language:kuery,query:''),timeRestore:!f,title:'Unique%20User%20Count',viewMode:view)`



### STEP 2 - Configuring the URL to get the dynamic lookup mechanisms ready.

Paste the copied URL in the destination URL box and click "**URL customization**". It'll automatically detect the timestamps from the URL and allowing you to set what value to be dynamic, for example, $hostname from the alert to be applied as a part of the query URL.

If the timestamps are not automatically detected, these are usually due to from the format of the timestamps either if it's encoded, has a different prefix or format itself (ISO, epoch etc.). There are two options to accommodate these varieties.

1. Go to [pitwall-extensions.md](../../pitwall-extensions.md "mention") in the main menu, and add your own extension to define the timestamp by regex. Also, you can contribute the extension to the PITWALL community so it'd be beneficial for everyone.
2. Contact us via a chat and we enable the extension for you.&#x20;

### STEP 3 - Enabling snapshot if you would like to prefetch and/or periodically take actual screenshot(s) of your existing sites / tools / dashboards.

If you'd like to attach a pre-fetched screenshot when you receive an alert, enable the snapshot.
