# 1. Trigger

After naming your scenario, you will define the source. There are types of scenarios. Pick the "Scheduled" to build a scheduled monitoring capability.&#x20;

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Scheduled" %}
Scheduled monitoring allows you to periodically generate links and capture screenshots.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Alert" %}
Team starts troubleshooting and analysis process from a triggered alert. This gives a team to correlate and stitch all the data you need to see across different tools.&#x20;
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Instant lookup" %}
This will give a simple but robust “look up” capability across what you would like to see. This is for more specific use cases such as [for-security-operation.md](../../../use-cases/for-security-operation.md "mention")and [for-researchers.md](../../../use-cases/for-researchers.md "mention"). Please refer to each use cases as well as another tutorial about configuring the "Text in browser" scenario here.
