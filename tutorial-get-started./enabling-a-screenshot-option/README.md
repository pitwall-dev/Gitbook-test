# ðŸ“· Enabling a screenshot option

## Overview

You can enable the screenshot for Instant triage, analysis and reporting in the [studio](../scenario-setup/alert/). Here is the use cases.

### 1. Instant triage

By enabling the snapshot option, your team will receive the Intelligent Alert with the pre-fetched screenshot of your tool. This will allow your team to instantly review the attached screenshot(s) instead of clicking all the links one by one. This is also powerful when you receive an alert in your mobile apps (Slack, MS Teams etc.) as there isn't a laptop wide screen that you can click and see individual tools. As tools like Slack decrease the resolution, there is also a high-resolution link attached for you to take a closer look.

### 2. Analysis (Event View)

If snapshot is enabled, your team can compare and analyze snapshots with any time in the past, past event (alert) and against a baseline (anomaly) in the [snapview.md](../analyze-an-incident/snapview.md "mention"). This is powerful for your organization to instantly review what are differences from what you saw in the past, apply[pin-tag-and-comment.md](../debrief/pin-tag-and-comment.md "mention")on the event itself or individual snapshot, and [insights.md](../analyze-an-incident/insights.md "mention") helps you find differences and anomalies more automated ways.

### 3. Reporting and Documentation

All the snapshots your team took are downloadable as PNG. This will allow you to use them in your report or documentation for your organization and/or your customers.
