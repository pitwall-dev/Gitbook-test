# ⏮️ Debrief

### Overview

A single question in the debrief as a DevOps / SRE team is **:**\
**What could've been better to solve the issue faster?**\
PITWALL is built for the organization's sustainability. Standardization, shared knowledge and experience to forge team's foundation is key to success. Debrief is designed to be used to record what you saw in an incident, was there any missing data / dashboard team actually needed? Based on the review in the debrief, updating a scenario to add a new look up is a 1 min job.

### **Features**

It is a never ending journey (until we have an era we don't have to operate any applications anymore), but here are list of features PITWALL gives you.

*   [Event log](event-log-insights.md)

    This will give you an ability to review all the lookups and snapshots (if configured) per event by event. Also, it'll allow you to compare with anytime of the past (look back) and past event(s).
* [Insights](event-log-insights.md)\
  PITWALL has been adding a capability around image processing to help you accelerate and simplify your triage and incident analysis work. Starting from similarity analysis, text level comparison powered by text extraction technologies and baseline analysis based on your business logic.
* [PIN, TAG and COMMENT](pin-tag-and-comment.md)\
  This is the 1st step of debrief, where you remark, leave a comment of what was indicating signal in a critical chart with in your multiple dashboards. Also, this should be used by experts in your team to leave tips, design consideration (which should be backlogged) and corrective actions needed for the very next incident which may happen even today.
