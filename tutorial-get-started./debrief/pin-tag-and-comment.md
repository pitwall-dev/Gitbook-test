# PIN, TAG and COMMENT

## Overview

This feature is designed to be used by experts first in your team to leave tips, design consideration (which should be backlogged) and corrective actions needed for the very next incident which may happen even today. The review by the entire team including juniors and managers is highly recommended as a part of debrief session what your team saw in an incident, if there was any missing data / dashboard team actually needed, and ultimately to come up with a plan where we can do a faster and better job.

Every incident is different, sometimes pre-configured scenario doesn’t give all the information your team needs to instantly identify the cause of the issue or getting the right insights. That’s where features like PIN, TAG and Comment come with -

* **PIN** allows any team members to pin key screenshot for everyone’s review, representing an unique symptom we should remember for the future cases.
* **TAG** to add attributes to each screenshots. This will allow team to filter screenshots by TAGs to identify the cause of the issue faster by more organized way + more team members (not only experts) can do the job. TAGs should be relatively short keyword(s) to characterise the commonality, what’s important and where to look at.
* **Comment** allows team to provide additional information for the troubleshooting and more importantly this is used for the continuous improvement and democratization of the experts' knowledge and expertise. This is a free format description more human readable sentences.
