# 1-Click Alert

## Overview

"1-Click Alert" stitches what you would like to review across different tools as clickable links and prefetched snapshot(s) at the time of an alert triggered by your monitoring tools (such as Coralogix, Splunk, New Relic etc). No experience changes, you will receive this productive alert just like an alert from other tools.

This "1-click experience" allow you to obtain what you need from different tools instead of manually opening a browser, switching one tool to another, adjusting the time range of the dashboard back to the time of an alert.  The process is defined in the Studio without making any changes to your current tools.
