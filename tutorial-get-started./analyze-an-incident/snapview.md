# SnapView

## Overview

Snapview help you to compare and analyze an incident with the followings to help identify where the issue is by providing three different angles per destination tools. Comparing with :&#x20;

1. Look back (time in the past)
2. Past events
3. Baseline

### Look back <a href="#other-times" id="other-times"></a>

This allows users to check the same view with different time range on-demand basis.\
For example, the same dashboard for the same time but sometime in the past. There are preset look back options or select any particular date / time.

### Past events <a href="#past-evemts" id="past-evemts"></a>

Users can also check the same view at the time of past events (alerts / incidents). \
For example if your event is #125, you will have an access to the same view of past event(s).

* \#125 - event you need to troubleshoot.
* \#120 - past event you would like to review.
* \#081 - past event you would like to review.

### Baseline <a href="#baselines" id="baselines"></a>

This will require a set of ML and data (captured snapshots), but this will give whatâ€™s usual to the devops team at the time of troubleshooting. The example is from AWS synthetic analysis, which is constantly accessing a website to record its response times and set a baseline. PITWALL does provide this for actual snapshots you defined (dashboard images).
